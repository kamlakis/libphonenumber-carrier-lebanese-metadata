# What is it?

Libphonenumber(https://github.com/googlei18n/libphonenumber/) is a library provided by Google for parsing, formatting, and validating international phone numbers.

The lebanese metadata that comes with the library doesn't include all the lebanese phone numbers ranges. I've created a custom metadata for lebanese numbers and compiled it using the method described here(https://github.com/googlei18n/libphonenumber/blob/master/making-metadata-changes.md)


# Steps to do

just download and copy `/com/google/i18n/phonenumbers/carrier/data/961_en` to your class path.
